# Why This Tool?

The standard jigs for assembling Opulo's drive wheel are often insufficient for precise alignment during the gluing process. Thatâ€™s why I designed this easy-to-print jig to simplify the task for everyone.

## Features and Benefits

- **Required Screws**:  
  - The jig requires three M3x12mm screws, preferably flat head.  
  - Standard M3x12mm screws can also be used, but they will protrude slightly on the other side. This is perfectly fine if flat head screws are not available.  
  - Flat head screws save material and printing time but are optional.

- **Design Purpose**:  
  - The jig is designed to align the drive wheel with the "print-in-place" shaft.  
  - It allows the shaft collar to slide onto the shaft and be secured to the drive wheel using the set screw.

- **Assembly Instructions**:  
  - Insert the M3x12mm screws into the jig and secure them with M3 nuts to prevent them from falling out.  
  - The screws are long enough to hold the drive wheel in place. Optionally, you can secure the wheel further with another M3 nut.  
  - The drive wheel can also be fixed directly with the shaft collar by tightening the set screw once aligned.

- **Adhesive**:  
  - Use a fast-curing adhesive like *Loctite 401* or a similar instant glue to attach the drive wheel components securely.

## Printing Instructions

- **Material**: PLA  
- **Printer**: Ender 3 or similar  
- **Print Time**: Approximately 26 minutes  
- **Infill**: 20%  
- **Supports**: Enabled  
- **Orientation**: Place the large circular side flat on the build plate

## Additional Information

- You can find both the STL and STEP files on my [GitHub](#) for downloading or customizing.  
- When gluing multiple drive wheels at once (e.g., 30 units), print as many jigs as needed to speed up the process.
