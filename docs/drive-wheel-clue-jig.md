!!! info "Refer to OHAI-Opulo Instructions"
    Always refer to the OHAI-Opulo instructions: [https://ohai.opulo.io/feeder8/indexing-wheel/#glue-shaft-collar-asm-and-drive-wheel-together](https://ohai.opulo.io/feeder8/indexing-wheel/#glue-shaft-collar-asm-and-drive-wheel-together)


# Why This Tool?

The standard jigs for assembling Opulo's drive wheel are often insufficient for precise alignment during the gluing process. Thatâ€™s why I designed this easy-to-print jig to simplify the task for everyone.


## Additional Information

!!! info "Files"
    - You can find both the STL and STEP files on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Technolitix/shaft-aligment-jig.git) for downloading or customizing.  
    - When gluing multiple drive wheels at once (e.g., 30 units), print as many jigs as needed to speed up the process.


## Features and Benefits

!!! info "Required Parts"
    - N20 Motor (best use the N20 motors you already have for the peel motor)
    - The jig requires three M3x12mm screws, preferably flat head.  
    - Standard M3x12mm screws can also be used, but they will protrude slightly on the other side. This is perfectly fine if flat head screws are not available.  
    - Flat head screws save material and printing time but are optional.

- **Design Purpose**:  
  - The jig is designed to align the drive wheel with the "N20 Motor" shaft.  
  - It allows the shaft collar to slide onto the N20 motor shaft and be secured to the drive wheel and N20 shaft, using the set screw.

- **Assembly Instructions**:  
  - Insert the M3x12mm screws into the jig and secure them with M3 nuts to prevent them from falling out.  
  - The screws are long enough to hold the drive wheel in place. Optionally, you can secure the wheel further with another 3x M3 nuts.  
  - The drive wheel can also be fixed directly with the shaft collar by tightening the set screw once aligned.

!!! info "Adhesive"
    Use a fast-curing adhesive like *Loctite 435* or a similar instant glue to attach the drive wheel components securely.

## Printing Instructions

- **Material**: PLA  
- **Printer**: Ender 3 or similar  
- **Print Time**: Approximately 27 minutes  
- **Infill**: 20%  
- **Supports**: Enabled  
- **Orientation**: Place the smaller circular side flat on the build plate

!!! warning "N20 Shaft"
    Be carefull with putting the N20 motor shaft into the 3D print, it is designed to be very tight, had to use some pressure and a bit of wiggeling to get it in the hole. If you have trubble getting it in, use a heatgun or lighter to heat the shaft and push it in, not to hot, else you deform the shape and therfor the alignment of the collar.
